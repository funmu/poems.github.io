Birthday Wishes For my Wife
——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ———

Hey Dear, My Dear wife!
it is a wonderful day!
It is your day!
It is your birthday!

Here is a sweet cake
reminding us
of the sweet family we make!

Dreams you have
may be reams of them.
Wishes I have, reams of them;
for your dreams to come true!

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)

Life is an adventure;
a wanderer like me can be easily lost.
Instead here you are,
engaged with your love and care.

It may seems like miles
that I want to travel.
Instead here I am
delighted to enjoy your smiles.

With you by my side,
I can travel many miles.
Just keep alive your smiles!

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)

I wish you many more happy birthdays ahead!
Enjoy your birthday.

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)
