Onwards towards the light
——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ———

Let us remember that
there are lights to guide us.

In these tough periods,
when our bodies tire,
when dreams may be on fire,
when our minds lag,
when our spirits sag,
our souls may seem lost,
Our hopes might also seem lost.

Let us remember that
there are lights to guide us.

In these darkest times,
We dream of comforting moments.
In these challenging situations,
we have helpful people.
In these trying times,
There are many small lights.

Let us remember that
there are lights to guide us.

It is these tough periods
 that bring the best of
 compassion and company,
 to make this a better world!

There is more hope
 to have of better days to come.
There is more goodness
 to share the hope around.

With hope and prayers,
Let us continue to dream
and toil ahead
with lights to guide us!

Let us remember that
there are lights to guide us.
