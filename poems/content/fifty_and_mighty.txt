 Fifty and Mighty
-------------------
 One fine Wednesday morning,
   two decades and two years back;
   I met this wonderful couple;
   Since then they have supported me back!
   I met a wonderful person in their house;
   That person had since become my wife.

 One fine Wednesday morning,
   two decades and two years back;
  The wonderful couple I met,
   had placed on me their bet.
  Learned elders they were,
  Blessed they always are.

 And now on this fine Wednesday morning,
  years they have been married, reached fifty!
  Our world is blessed with their presence, mighty
   well to guide our generation to be nifty,
   skillful, and strong to shape many a life story.

 And now on this fine Wednesday morning,
  years they have been married, reached fifty!
  We have the fond memories of yonder past;
  We have the fun thoughts of wonder future;
  We have their prayers and blessings ever present.

 And now on this fine Wednesday morning,
  years they have been married, reached fifty!
  We know that they lead with EST!
  We thank them with our zest;
  We wish them the very best!
