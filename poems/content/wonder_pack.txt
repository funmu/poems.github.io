 Wonder Pack
——— ——— ——— ———

First there was a knock,
 Opened the door wide,
   to see who comes from outside.
 There was this smiling girl,
  pulling something from her sack.
There was a nicely wrapped pack.

What I wonder the pack has?
 A pack that is well covered;
 A pack that nicely waited;
 A pack that had our curiosity peaked;
 A pack that just has to be opened.

First there was a knock
Then there was a pack.

What I wonder the pack has?
 Soon we popped open the pack.
 We found a few rounds and squares;
 We found a few whites and greens;
 We found a few pinks and yellows.

First there was a knock
Then there was a pack.

What I wonder the pack has?
 Many items that waited for us.
 The items invited us to touch and feel;
 The items invited us to smell and taste;
 Oh they tasted real good indeed.

First there was a knock
Then there was a pack.

What I wonder the pack has?
 All the items walked into many mouths.
 Some tasted crunchy and sweet;
 Some tasted buttery and sweet;
 Some tasted fruity and sweet;

First there was a knock
Then there was a pack.

What I wonder the pack had?
 Has now vanished in our mouths.
 What we got are thanks
 to the friends who sent
 these wonderful sweets to us.

First there was a knock
Then there was a pack.
