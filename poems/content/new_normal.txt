The New Normal

We were normal;
We sought things, novel!

We had weekdays and weekends.
We made things during weekdays;
We enjoyed things during the weekends.
Such was the working life.

Too much novelty may not be the best
for who would have thought about the rest?

We were normal;
We sought things, novel!

Suddenly from Wuhan,
 sprang a virus, was indeed novel!

Invisible though, it was at first insurmountable.
Invisible though, it wreaked havoc aplenty.
Invisible though, it had no marketing budget;
Invisible though, it caught worldwide attention.

Such is the wonder, if we can say so.
We find ourselves in this new normal.

United we need to take a stand;
Though, we need to be in self-isolation.

With hopes for a better future
wherein, this novel virus is tamed,
wherein, this new normal goes away
wherein, we are back to another new normal.

With hopes for a better future
whence, the kids are back at school,
whence, we are back at our workplaces,
whence, we are free to roam the world,
whence, we are with more physical social connections.
Then, we are awake in the world afresh,
With gratitude and dreams.

Context

In March 2020, we had seen the spread of COVID19 virus in the USA.
Office workers are going remote; health care workers are on alert,
 schools and universities were also going remote. 
We are entering a new world now.
