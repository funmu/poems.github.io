 Birthday Wishes For my Wife
——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ———

Hey Dear, My Dear wife!
it is a wonderful day!
It is your day!
It is your birthday!

Here is a sweet cake
 reminding us
of the sweet family we make!

Dreams you have
 may be reams of them.
Wishes I have, reams of them;
 for your dreams to come true!

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)

Life is an adventure;
 a wanderer like me can be easily lost.
Instead here you are,
 engaged with your love and care.

It may seems like miles
 that I want to travel.
Instead here I am
 delighted to enjoy your smiles.

With you by my side,
I can travel many miles.
Just keep alive your smiles!

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)

I wish you many more happy birthdays ahead!
Enjoy your birthday.

( Hey Dear, My Dear wife!)

  Onwards towards the light
 ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ———

 Let us remember that
  there are lights to guide us.

 In these tough periods,
  when our bodies tire,
  when dreams may be on fire,
  when our minds lag,
  when our spirits sag,
  our souls may seem lost,
 Our hopes might also seem lost.

 Let us remember that
  there are lights to guide us.

 In these darkest times,
  We dream of comforting moments.
 In these challenging situations,
  we have helpful people.
 In these trying times,
  There are many small lights.

 Let us remember that
  there are lights to guide us.

 It is these tough periods
   that bring the best of
   compassion and company,
   to make this a better world!

 There is more hope
   to have of better days to come.
 There is more goodness
   to share the hope around.

 With hope and prayers,
  Let us continue to dream
  and toil ahead
  with lights to guide us!

 Let us remember that
  there are lights to guide us.

   Wonder Pack
 ——— ——— ——— ———

  First there was a knock,
    Opened the door wide,
      to see who comes from outside.
    There was this smiling girl,
     pulling something from her sack.
  There was a nicely wrapped pack.

  What I wonder the pack has?
    A pack that is well covered;
    A pack that nicely waited;
    A pack that had our curiosity peaked;
    A pack that just has to be opened.

  First there was a knock
  Then there was a pack.

  What I wonder the pack has?
    Soon we popped open the pack.
    We found a few rounds and squares;
    We found a few whites and greens;
    We found a few pinks and yellows.

  First there was a knock
  Then there was a pack.

  What I wonder the pack has?
    Many items that waited for us.
    The items invited us to touch and feel;
    The items invited us to smell and taste;
    Oh they tasted real good indeed.

  First there was a knock
  Then there was a pack.

  What I wonder the pack has?
    All the items walked into many mouths.
    Some tasted crunchy and sweet;
    Some tasted buttery and sweet;
    Some tasted fruity and sweet;

  First there was a knock
  Then there was a pack.

  What I wonder the pack had?
    Has now vanished in our mouths.
    What we got are thanks
    to the friends who sent
    these wonderful sweets to us.

  First there was a knock
  Then there was a pack.
